In command mode, for input - It is expected that that the input-Path/File should be given within quotation (""). This is done to handle spaces in between File Names of Directory Names.

Ex:
rename "AOS 1" "AOS"
copy "./AOS/Assignment/Assignment 1/temp2" "AOS" "~/Work" "~/Videos"
create_file "123 abc.txt" "~/Work/IIIT Hyderabad/Semester-1"
